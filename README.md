Exploring D2L (Dive into Deep Learning)

Ps: My laptop does not have a GPU so I have tweaked this code so it runs without GPU parallel processing.

You need to have PyTorch installed

You need to have the d2l package installed

Training the model is resource intensive and it takes atleast two hours for my non GPU machine to complete training.

For this model I am using 100-dimensional GloVe embeddings.
